    "* unlike Python List, the Array is much more rigid. That is, the items that an array contains must be of the same type. Therefore, the size of the item will also be the same. We can check the size of each item\n",
    "* Since the type code is very important to an array, which determined what kind of elements that the array can have. We can get the type code by accessing its property typecode\n",
